Some of the factors impacting the attendance of a booked slot were months of membership and type of excercises booked for. <br>
The analysis notebook linked goes into depth about the findings. <br>

Uses logistic regression and xgboost machine learning algorithms to predict whether a booked slot will be attended.<br>
These predictions are used to find out the factors with most influence on the attendance.

The analysis results in this project could potentially increase GoalZone's customer retention and aid in new customer attraction.
